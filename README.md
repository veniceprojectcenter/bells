# Venice Bells

This app shows a map of venice bells with their pictures and sounds

## Notes

Even with some traces of php, it seems that this is the most updated version of the bells app, it's been written in js, takes its images from [cityknowledge s3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cityknowledge/), also for interactive tours it uses [Theta360](https://theta360.com) and for the data it uses [the cityknowledge firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/firebase-cityknowledge/overview) through ckconsole.
