			<p>This is the website for the Venice Bells IQP.</p>
			<p>
			This website offers a one of a kind source of knowledge on both the bells and the bell towers of Venice. The goal of our project is to help preserve the 
			material culture of bells and bell towers in the city of Venice by gaining knowledge on their historical significance and by creating an extensive source 
			of information that will reconnect modern Venice with its past. </p>
			<p>
			This website aims to provide the public with a free source of
			information collected by the Venice Project Center, led by Fabio Carrera and run by the students of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. </p>
			<h2 align="center">2013 Team</h1>
			<p>Our objectives, for the eight weeks we have had here in Venice, are to:</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>To investigate the condition of bell towers, their bells, and clocks, and their potential reuse.</li>
				<li>To update the catalogue of adaptive reuse of convents in Venice.</li>
				<li>To promote the preservation of church floor artifacts and guild altars.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is the website for the Venice Bells IQP.</p>
			<p>
			This website offers a one of a kind source of knowledge on both the bells and the bell towers of Venice. The goal of our project is to help preserve the 
			material culture of bells and bell towers in the city of Venice by gaining knowledge on their historical significance and by creating an extensive source

			<p>
			As a product of the 2012 Worcester Polytechnic Interactive Qualifying Project team, this website aims to provide the public with a free source of
			information collected by the Venice Project Center, led by Fabio Carrera and run by the students of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Our objectives, for the eight weeks we 
			have had here in Venice, are to:</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organize bell data from past Venice projects</li>
				<li>Update old information on the bells and bell towers in Venice</li>
				<li>Distribute collected bell data to the public</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			This website accomplishes our last goal by providing an outlet for users to learn interactively.
			To use some of our applications navigate to the Home (for the main map), Bells, or Project Links tabs on the toolbar at the top. 
			To see some of our other contributions to preserving the material culture of Venice's bells and belltowers, check out our "Project Links" section.
			</p>	
			<p>The members of Venice Bells Team create an eclectic group of skill sets. All its members play a vital
			role in restoring appreciation to Venice's many bells and bell towers.</p>

			<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of our advisors Professors Fabio Carrera and John Zeugner. We are very
			thankful for all of their help and guidance, and of their really helping to make this project a reality.</p>
